I am assuming you have php installed. I am assuming your apache server knows how to deal with php. You might not have php5-myql installed, you need 
that too.
Also I assume that you already have a stendhal server set up, with a database created for the game.

The stendhal website connects to the stendhal game database to get up to the minute game data.

You will need to edit configuration.php with the username, pw and db name of the stendhal game db on your system. 
You won't have a stendhal website db yet.
So log in to mysql: mysql -u NAME -p (you may need to be root to create databases!)
create database stendhal_website;
grant all on stendhal_website.* to 'FOO'@'localhost' identified by 'BAR';

Check the username, pw and database name again match those for the website database in configuration.php.

Now in the stendhal_website directory run the command  mysql stendhal_website -u FOO -p <stendhal_website.sql and enter the password when prompted. 
It should return silently. It has some example news items and events in it already so I guess if you don't like them, edit them first!

You will find a README in the data/ folder which tells you what to add there.

To make outfit create script work you need gd installed, if you haven't got it already. The correct program name for apt types is php5-gd.

To edit news and events just go into mysql and edit the appropriate tables.
Or if you have an account on the game server with adminlevel >= 400 you can login to the website (top right) and edit the news and events using the 
GUI.
To allow people to upload screenshots you need to chmod a+w on your screenshots directory.
